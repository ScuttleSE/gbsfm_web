| Restarting g2 from scratch |
|____________________________|


- Ensure no relevent processes are still running:
$ killall sc_serv
$ killall manage.py
$ killall python
$ killall ices

- Ensure lighttpd is running

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd start
  
  (note: to properly restart lighttpd, manage.py must first be killed if it's running)

- Ensure a couple of environment variables are set correctly
  $ export PYTHONPATH="/home/jonnty/pydj"
  $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="pydj.settings"

- Start the website

  $ cd ~jonnty/pydj
  $ ./manage.py runfcgi method=prefork socket=/tmp/fcgi.sock maxrequests=500 maxchildren=7
  
  (This'll take about 10 seconds - in the meantime, it'll display an error page. Don't panic.)

- Start the FTP server

  $ cd ~jonnty/pydj/playlist
  $ nohup python ftp.py &

- Start the shoutcast server

  $ cd ~jonnty/sc_serv
  $ nohup ./sc_serv &

- The ices server can now be started from the website. If, for some reason, that doesn't work, this command should:
  
  $ cd ~/jonnty/playlist/logic
  $ ices0 -c ices.conf
  
  (This will terminate/not start if the website is down for too long, as it relies upon it for finding out what the next song is. 
  Therefore, it must always be run after the website has finished starting up.)
  
  
Wonderful music should now be flowing into the ears of about 5 people. If not, something's gone wrong. As a first resort, check ices.log and any server error messages. Otherwise, get me.
