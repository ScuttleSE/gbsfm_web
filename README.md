# gbsfm_web
The skeleton of the gbs.fm website

This is _not_ all you need to get up and running.

You'll also need:

* A MySQL/MariaDB database with the proper schema (Contact me privately to get a copy)
* A Liquidsoap-based streamer (to come)
* Discord and IRC-bots (to come)
* Some other stuff I probably forgot
